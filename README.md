Build a Technical Documentation Page

A certification project on freeCodeCamp

Going to use "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology" as the source material to make the page out of. The contents part will be the sidebar. I may add a section in order to fullfil the requirements of the automatic tests. Otherwise the text is copy from wikipedia. 

Going to practice git during the project too like the earlier ones.

### Reflection

Need to better study the problem before tackling it. In doing so I won't end up cheating myself by looking at the given example with the dev tools if I get stuck as a consequence of choosing boundary conditions not conducive to being graded on the automated tests. Drawing stuff out on paper is valuable.

Solution: copy and pasting banned for all learning. Only typing line by line. Digestion rule - dissect and assimilate.  

### Next

Skipping to animations then SASS in preparation for web development boot-camp. Might need grid too.

Making a diary/journal to detail learning on github. Make a repository with directories for each year and file for each month. Have road-map in there too.

Clean repos folder out. Make directory for eah language. Sub-directory for each main learning source.

Learn basic markdown for tasks

Make current learning tasks heading in git journal.

Make principles/advice section to hold learning rules
