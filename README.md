Build a Technical Documentation Page

A certification project on freeCodeCamp

Going to use "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology" as the source material to make the page out of. The contents part will be the sidebar. I may add a section in order to fullfil the requirements of the automatic tests. Otherwise the text is copy from wikipedia. 

Going to practice git during the project too like the earlier ones.
