Build a Technical Documentation Page

A certification project on freeCodeCamp

Going to use "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology" as the source material to make the page out of. The contents part will be the sidebar. I may add a section in order to fullfil the requirements of the automatic tests. Otherwise the text is copy from wikipedia. 

Going to practice git during the project too like the earlier ones.

### Reflection

Need to better study the problem before tackling it. In doing so I won't end up cheating myself by looking at the given example with the dev tools if I get stuck as a consequence of choosing boundary conditions not conducive to being graded on the automated tests. Drawing stuff out on paper is valuable.

Solution: copy and pasting banned for all learning. Only typing line by line. Digestion rule - dissect and assimilate.
